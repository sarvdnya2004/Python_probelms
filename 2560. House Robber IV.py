# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [2,3,5,9], k = 2
# Output: 5
# Explanation: 
# There are three ways to rob at least 2 houses:
# - Rob the houses at indices 0 and 2. Capability is max(nums[0], nums[2]) = 5.
# - Rob the houses at indices 0 and 3. Capability is max(nums[0], nums[3]) = 9.
# - Rob the houses at indices 1 and 3. Capability is max(nums[1], nums[3]) = 9.
# Therefore, we return min(5, 9, 9) = 5.
# Example 2:

# Input: nums = [2,7,9,3,1], k = 2
# Output: 2
# Explanation: There are 7 ways to rob the houses. The way which leads to minimum capability is to rob the house at index 0 and 4. Return max(nums[0], nums[4]) = 2.
 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= nums.length <= 105
# 1 <= nums[i] <= 109
# 1 <= k <= (nums.length + 1)/2
